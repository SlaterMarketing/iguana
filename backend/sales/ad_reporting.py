"""Tell Meta what an ad was worth, from the order it produced.

`crm.meta_capi` knows how to talk to Meta; this knows what an Iguana order looks like. Split that way because the
checkout runs in an iframe on the API domain: the browser cookies Meta matches on (`_fbp`, `_fbc`) belong to the
SITE origin, so they can only reach us by riding along in the checkout payload. `k.js` reads them on the site and
posts them as attribution, `checkout_start` stores them on the order, and both functions here read them back.

Matching is everything. An event with only a hashed email attributes far fewer sales than one that also carries
the click id, the browser id, the IP and the user agent, and an unattributed sale teaches the algorithm that the
ad did not work.
