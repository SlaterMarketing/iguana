"""Keep the open mic ads on, except when there is nothing left to sell them for.

The owner's rule (2026-09-26): the open mic campaigns run always, and each one stops when its night sells out
or one hour before the show starts. It comes back on by itself for the following week's night. A cron calls
`sync()` every ten minutes; nothing in a request path touches Meta.

Why the switch is per LANGUAGE and not per night: the ads point at /open-mic/?night=es or ?night=en, which
always shows the next bookable night of that series, so one campaign per series is the thing that sells every
Tuesday (or every Wednesday) in turn. The night that decides whether it runs is the next one on the calendar.

Only the CAMPAIGN status is touched. Which ad sets inside it are live is a builder decision
(`scripts/meta-openmic-campaigns.py` pauses superseded ones and keeps the retired reach campaigns off), and a
switch that also flipped ad sets would undo those decisions every ten minutes.

⚠ It overrides a pause made by hand in Ads Manager within ten minutes, because "always" is the rule. To stop
the ads on purpose, set `open_mic_ads_autopilot: false` in group_vars and deploy, then pause them.
