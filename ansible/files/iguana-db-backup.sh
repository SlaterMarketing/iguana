# Nightly database backup for Iguana Comedy, installed by deploy.yml, run by /etc/cron.d/iguana-backup as root.
#
# Dump, then PROVE the dump restores, then prune. A backup that has never been restored is a hope, so every
# night the fresh dump is loaded into a scratch database and its row counts are checked against the live ones
# before anything old is deleted. If any step fails, nothing is pruned and an email goes out.
#
#   daily/   every night, kept KEEP_DAILY days
#   weekly/  Sunday's dump, kept KEEP_WEEKLY days
#   media/   Sunday tarball of backend/media (uploaded posters), kept KEEP_MEDIA days
#
# The dev box pulls this directory every night (ansible/files/pull-iguana-backups.sh), because a backup that
# lives on the same disk as the database dies with it.
# No -E: an ERR trap inherited into $(...) subshells fires there, the subshell exits, and the script
# carries on to fail a second time. Without it the failed substitution trips the trap once, in the main shell.
