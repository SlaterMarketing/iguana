# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Iguana Comedy (stand-up promoter, Quintana Roo, Mexico). Two apps in one repo: a bilingual **Astro 5 SSR site**
(repo root) and a **Django backend** (`backend/`) that replaced the Kintana SaaS the site was originally built on.
Repo is `SlaterMarketing/iguana` (public, client-owned). Backend, deploy and migration work lives on branch
`backend-django`, which has not been pushed: ask before pushing anywhere.

## Commands

```bash
# Site (Node 20, see .node-version)
npm install
npm run dev                      # Astro dev server; needs .env + .dev.vars (copy the .example files)
npm run build                    # Cloudflare Pages build (default adapter) + scripts/verify-dist.mjs
npm run build:node               # ASTRO_ADAPTER=node standalone server -> dist/server/entry.mjs (what production runs)
npm run start:node               # run that build
npx astro check                  # type check (pre-existing errors on Locals.brandOverrides in middleware.ts)

# Backend (Django 6, SQLite locally via config.py, Postgres in production)
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
cp config_example.py config.py   # DEBUG=True, SITE_URLS, PUBLIC_API_KEYS, EMAIL_BACKEND console for local
.venv/bin/python manage.py migrate
.venv/bin/python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000
.venv/bin/python manage.py test api                                            # all backend tests
.venv/bin/python manage.py test api.tests.CheckoutTests.test_member_free_tickets_then_guest_discount  # one test

# Data (one-off / re-runnable, fill blanks unless --overwrite)
.venv/bin/python manage.py import_kintana_export ~/iguana-migration/export     # client's Kintana CSV export
.venv/bin/python manage.py import_archive                                      # Wayback-recovered comedians/venues/posters/merch
.venv/bin/python manage.py seed_site_defaults                                  # form endpoints + membership plan pricing
.venv/bin/python manage.py send_test_email someone@example.com                 # mail test as DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL

# Production (run from ansible/; inventory + group_vars/all are gitignored, secrets come from ~/.credentials)
ansible-playbook deploy.yml                    # rsync this checkout, build, migrate, restart, apply mail.yml
ansible-playbook deploy.yml --tags all,certs   # also issue missing Let's Encrypt certs listed in cert_sets
ansible-playbook email_check.yml               # end-to-end mail verification (asserts on DNS, DKIM, delivery)
```

Local pairing: backend on `127.0.0.1:8000`, site on `127.0.0.1:4321` with `.env` / `.dev.vars` setting
`PUBLIC_KINTANA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000` and `PUBLIC_KINTANA_API_KEY` to a key from `config.PUBLIC_API_KEYS`.

## Architecture

### The site still talks "Kintana", the backend answers it

The Astro code calls `@kintana/sdk` (vendored tarball in `vendor/`) everywhere. Rather than rewrite the site, the
Django backend implements the same HTTP contract, so only the base URL and key differ:

- `backend/api/public_views.py`: `/api/public/v1/{events,artists,venues,endpoints,store,files,site}`
- `backend/api/fan_views.py`: `/api/fan/v1/*` (magic-link sign-in, profile, tickets, memberships, redeem codes,
  credit transfers, Stripe subscribe / one-off / billing portal)
- `backend/api/embed_views.py`: `/_t/k.js` (drop-in for Kintana's tracker script), `/embed/event/<id>` (checkout
  iframe), `/orders/<token>/`, staff `/checkin/<token>/`, `/api/stripe/webhook`, `/api/ingest/*`
- `backend/api/serializers.py` produces the exact SDK JSON shapes. When the site needs a field, check the SDK
  types in `node_modules/@kintana/sdk/dist/*.d.ts` and add it there.

Auth: the site's key arrives as `Authorization: Bearer` (checked by `api_view` in `api/auth.py`); signed-in fans add
`X-Customer-Authorization: Bearer <signed token>` issued by `auth/verify`. Browser calls rely on
`api/middleware.py` CORS for `SITE_URLS`.

Checkout flow: `EventCheckoutWidget.astro` renders `data-kintana-widget="event:<id>"`; `k.js` injects the iframe,
posts the fan token in, and follows `kintana-embed-checkout-success` to the order page. Prices are always
computed server-side in `sales/services.py::price_cart` (member free tickets priciest-first, then guest discount;
member pricing only when checkout email equals the signed-in member). With `DEBUG=True` and no Stripe keys the
iframe offers a simulated payment; in production without keys it refuses payment.

Backend apps: `catalog` (venues, artists, events, lineup, ticket types, store, form endpoints, site files),
`crm` (contacts, lists, campaigns, inbox history, tracked events), `sales` (orders, tickets, memberships, plans,
redeem codes, credit transfers, login tokens), `api` (views only, no models). Image fields hold either absolute
URLs or `/media/...` paths; `serializers.media()` makes them absolute with `BACKEND_URL`.

### Site structure

- `output: "server"`: every page renders per request from the API. Pages hold no data at build time.
- Routes are locale-prefixed and translated: `src/i18n/routes.ts` maps route keys to `/en/...` and `/es/...`
  slugs; always build links with `localizePath(locale, key, params)`. UI strings live in `src/i18n/ui.ts` via
  `t(locale, key, vars)`.
- `src/pages/en/**` and `src/pages/es/**` are parallel thin wrappers around shared components
  (`<EventsIndexPage locale="es" />`). A page change usually means touching both trees or the shared component.
- `src/middleware.ts`: `/` picks a locale (cookie, Accept-Language), 301s Framer-era URLs via
  `legacyRedirectTarget` in `src/lib/legacy-paths.ts`, and loads brand-image overrides from `listFiles`.
- `src/lib/kintana-env.ts` reads env from Cloudflare runtime, `process.env`, then `import.meta.env`. Public vars
  must use Astro's `PUBLIC_` prefix; `KINTANA_SECRET_API_KEY` is server-only and must never reach islands.
- React islands only where hooks are needed: contact form (`ContactFormIsland`, `useKintanaSubmit(slug)` with
  endpoint slugs `contact`, `perform-with-us`, `hotels-and-resorts`), account/sign-in, membership (Stripe
  Elements), event member offer.
- Event dates come from the API as `YYYY-MM-DD` (Cancun day) and the API sets `status: "past"` by the Cancun
  calendar, so filter on status rather than comparing against the server clock (`src/lib/home-page-data.ts`).
- Static brand media (logo, city photos, hero video) is self-hosted in `public/media/`, not on Kintana.
- `astro.config.mjs` switches adapter on `ASTRO_ADAPTER=node`; the Cloudflare build keeps its `react-dom/server.edge`
  aliases, the Node build must not use them.

### Production

One VPS (VPS.org `free` account, 38.86.78.36, user `iguana`, creds `~/.credentials/vpsorg/iguanacomedy/`).
nginx fronts supervisor programs `iguana:iguana-web` (Node, :3000) and `iguana:iguana-api` (gunicorn, :8001);
Postgres `iguana`. `iguanacomedy.com` is canonical (DNS on Cloudflare, records must stay DNS-only: proxied records
pointing at Cloudflare IPs caused the old Error 1000); `iguanacomedy.mx` 301s to it; API at
`api.iguanacomedy.com` (and `api.iguanacomedy.mx`). Admin: `https://api.iguanacomedy.com/admin/`.

- `ansible/files/nginx.conf.j2` renders TLS blocks only for certificates that exist (`cert_sets`), so redeploys
  never strip HTTPS. nginx is 1.24: use `listen 443 ssl http2`, not `http2 on`.
- Code is rsynced from the local checkout (not git-pulled). `backend/media/` syncs add-only so server uploads survive.
- Mail (`ansible/mail.yml`): Postfix + OpenDKIM for the `mail_zone` (`iguanacomedy.mx`), local mailboxes, no
  catch-all. 38.86.78.0/24 is on the Spamhaus PBL, so Postfix prefers IPv6 (Gmail rejects the v4 address).

### Data outside the repo

`~/iguana-migration/` holds the Kintana CSV export (customer PII), the Wayback Machine mirror, and
`extracted/*.json` + images recovered from the old Framer and Kintana-era sites. Never commit any of it.
`backend/local_data.json` fixtures are gitignored for the same reason.
